All humans have an unquenchable longing; the enemy and his "world" have convinced humanity that this feeling of always wanting more is called ambition, and that it will be fulfilled with more. More material possessions more recognition, more success, more fame, more and more and more. In [Mark 8:36](https://biblehub.com/kjv/mark/8-36.htm) we read "For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?"
It has been proven time, and time again that those that have it all are still looking for more and, more often than not, end up dying of an overdose after seeking solace in drugs or alcohol when they realize their chasing of "more" took them to a dead end.
What this world calls ambition is, in reality, a void left in the human heart when sin separated it from God. It is an infinite void only God can fill; there is nothing in this world that can come close to making a dent on it. One could own this entire planet, have every human being as a subject and it would not make any difference.
Total fulfillment will only come when we are face to face with our Creator, meanwhile, redemption though our Lord Jesus Christ ensures we will get to see our Father in Heaven again. But, what about life between the moment of redemption and the moment of fulfillment? Once we understand that only God can fill that infinite void, all we have to do is ask Him to start doing so. Jesus thought us to ask for God's Kingdom to come [(Mt 6:10)](https://biblehub.com/kjv/matthew/6-10.htm), in other words, he gave us a way of filling that infinite gap by asking God to establish His Kingdom in us, right here, right now.
God's Word is available to us; by reading it, and meditating about it [(Ps 1)](https://biblehub.com/kjv/psalms/1.htm), we are allowing our Heavenly Father to transform us, to bring His Kingdom into our hearts and souls.
How would we know if we are being transformed by His Love and Power?
One clear sign would be how things of this world start to lose importance, how earthly possessions become what they are supposed to be, a mean and not and end.
We go through life with a craving and we try everything in a quest to satisfy it. Once we "taste" God, we know only Him can fulfill us, all we have to do is allow Him to do so.
