Beloved Heavenly Father, thank you for allowing us to know that acknowledging Chris as our Lord and Savior, and believing that through His dead and resurrection, all our sins are forgiven, and that we are reconciled with You is the beginning of a journey, and not the end of the road of salvation.
You want us humans to become more and more like Jesus, therefor more and more like You. This is humanly impossible; "but with God all things are possible" [(Mt 19:26)](https://biblehub.com/kjv/matthew/19-26.htm).
Believing is the first step we have to take to receive Your Holy Spirit; believing allows You to start working on us, to start making us like You.
We must at all time relinquish all control to You Father, knowing that it is Your power that will transform us from inside out. Transform us until we become one with You.
I used to say "the form becomes the essence", meaning if we start doing things is a certain way, that "way" will eventually become part of our nature. This is as good as saying our human will and power are capable of transforming us and make us into the image of Christ our Father in Heaven wants us to be, thus denying His power and repeating that original sin.
Heavenly Father made us in His Image [(Gen 1:27)](https://biblehub.com/kjv/genesis/1-27.htm) and that is what He wants for us. When sin entered the world, men stopped being like our Father in Heaven and no human power can restore that. Jesus Christ's dead and resurrections gave us redemption thought forgiving of sins. However, God doesn't want to stop there, He wants us redeemed and sanctified. Sanctification means we becoming more and more like Christ, therefore more and more like our Heavenly Father [(Jn 10:30)](https://biblehub.com/kjv/genesis/1-27.htm).
As we couldn't get redemption without God's direct intervention, Jesus' death and resurrection; we could not get sanctification without His direct actions in our daily lives through His Holy Spirit.
Like in everything, God wants us to do our part for Him to do His; we must reaffirm our faith every day, every moment; and, we must **unconditionally surrender our will to His**.
Once we fully surrender, He will change us and sanctify us from inside our; our actions, our words, our thoughts will be a reflections of those changes.
In other words, when we allow it by surrendering to His Will, God begins to change our essence and our form will begin to show it.
