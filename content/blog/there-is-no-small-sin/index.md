![There is no small sin](./court-1.jpg)

Human justice quantifies crime according to the damage such crime produced against a human being or legal entity. By human standards, offenses are finite and measurable.
Sins, however, are committed against the Person of God and are, therefore, of an infinite nature.
Qualifying sin as mortal or venial, for example, minimizes its nature and takes into account who is offending instead of who is offended.
A king would severely punish a subject for disobeying the most menial of his decrees just because by doing so said subject is defying his kingship as a whole.
Sinning is offending God the Almighty, something that could never be measured by any human standards.
Once we sin, no action or works of our own can undo what has been done.Only a perfect sacrifice done by a perfect, divine being could clear us from the stain of sinfulness and make us acceptable in God's eyes.
God in His boundless Love took human form to offer that perfect sacrifice and had all our sins forgiven and forgotten. However, we must do our part: God wants us to repent and to confess in front of Him. He also wants us to commit to a life without sin knowing that our commitment is imperfect and that we will sin again. There is a big difference between choosing sin as a way of life and sinning because we are weak. Only God's Love can and will perfect us and take us away from sin.
